## Hi, there!

I’m Ahmad Febrianto, a CS student who has interests in IT Security, Mobile and Web App Development, Automation Script, Data Science and Machine Learning. In short, I am a ```Python``` and ```Kotlin (Android)``` developer.

I document everything I learned and created during my learning progress here. Hope you find them useful, although I know they are not.
